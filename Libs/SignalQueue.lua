Analysis of Your Code
Usage of Variable Arguments (...):
In Lua, ... correctly captures the variable arguments passed to a function. You 
have used it to pack these arguments into a table which is a good approach for 
transferring these values between threads.

However, in your send function, the usage of {signal, sendingThread, ...} will 
create a table where signal and sendingThread are the first two elements, and each 
additional argument from ... will be subsequent elements in the table.

Receiving and Unpacking Data:
Your receive function attempts to unpack the received data. Currently, it assumes 
that there are always exactly three pieces of data, which might not align with 
the variable nature of ....

If ... contains more than one value, entry[3] will not capture all of them, only 
the third one.

Explanation
Modification in Send Function: Now the entry table explicitly stores signal, 
sendingThread (renamed to sender for clarity), and the variable arguments (...) 
are stored in a separate table under the key args. This ensures that all 
variable arguments are kept together and can be easily unpacked later.
Modification in Receive Function: 
Now it extracts signal, sender, and args from the entry. It then returns these 
values, with table.unpack(args) used to return all variable arguments as 
separate return values. This change ensures that all variable arguments are 
correctly returned, regardless of their number.

This approach handles variable arguments robustly and ensures that your 
threading system can pass any number of additional parameters cleanly 
between sender and receiver threads.
