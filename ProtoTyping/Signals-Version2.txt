Your implementation already includes a robust system for managing signals in a thread-specific FIFO queue. Here are a few suggestions for additional functionality that might enhance your WoWThreads.lua library:

1. Signal Prioritization
Implement a priority system for signals, allowing more critical signals to be processed before less critical ones. This can be done by maintaining separate queues for different priority levels.

2. Timeout for Signals
Allow threads to wait for signals with a timeout mechanism. This can be useful if a thread needs to proceed after waiting for a certain period.

lua
Copy code
signal, err = thread:getSignalWithTimeout(timeout)
if err == TIMEOUT then
    -- handle timeout
else
    -- process signal
end
3. Signal Filtering
Provide a mechanism for threads to specify which signals they are interested in while yielding. This can help in reducing the overhead of processing irrelevant signals.

lua
Copy code
thread:yield({SIG_XXXX, SIG_YYYY})
4. Batch Signal Processing
Allow threads to retrieve and process multiple signals in a batch rather than one-by-one. This can improve performance in scenarios where a thread receives a large number of signals.

lua
Copy code
signals = thread:getSignalsBatch()
for _, signal in ipairs(signals) do
    -- process signal
end
5. Signal Handlers
Implement signal handlers, where specific functions can be registered to handle particular signals automatically.

lua
Copy code
thread:registerSignalHandler(SIG_XXXX, function()
    -- handle SIG_XXXX
end)
6. Asynchronous Signal Handling
Introduce an asynchronous mechanism for handling signals, where signal processing can be offloaded to another thread or performed in the background.

7. Thread-Specific Signal Statistics
Maintain and provide statistics about signals received by each thread, such as the number of signals processed, average processing time, etc.

8. Logging and Debugging Tools
Add logging and debugging tools to help track signal flow and thread states, which can be invaluable during development and troubleshooting.

9. Cancellation Signals
Implement a special type of signal for canceling or terminating a thread, ensuring that resources are properly cleaned up.

lua
Copy code
thread:sendSignal(CANCEL_SIGNAL)
10. Custom Signal Data
Allow signals to carry additional data, enabling more complex communication between threads.

lua
Copy code
thread:sendSignal(SIG_CUSTOM, {key = "value"})
Integrating some or all of these features can make your threads library more powerful and flexible, catering to a broader range of use cases and improving overall performance and usability.

Pseudo-Code
lua
Copy code
-- Thread library and signal mechanism setup
local Thread = require("WoWThreads")

-- Define a function to create and run a thread
function createThread(name, func)
    local thread = Thread.new(name)
    thread:run(func)
    return thread
end

-- Signal constants
local SIG_NONE_PENDING = 0
local SIG_CUSTOM = 1
local SIG_CALLBACK = 2

-- Function for Thread A
function threadA()
    print("Thread A: Started")
    -- Register a callback signal handler
    Thread.registerSignalHandler(SIG_CALLBACK, function(data)
        print("Thread A: Received callback with data:", data)
        -- Process callback data
    end)
    
    -- Simulate doing some work and then waiting for a signal
    while true do
        local signal, data = Thread.yield()
        if signal == SIG_CUSTOM then
            print("Thread A: Received custom signal, notifying Thread B")
            -- Notify Thread B with a signal
            Thread.sendSignal("ThreadB", SIG_CALLBACK, "Callback data from Thread A")
        end
    end
end

-- Function for Thread B
function threadB()
    print("Thread B: Started")
    -- Simulate waiting for a signal
    while true do
        local signal, data = Thread.yield()
        if signal == SIG_CALLBACK then
            print("Thread B: Received callback signal from Thread A with data:", data)
            -- Do something with the data and notify Thread A back
            Thread.sendSignal("ThreadA", SIG_CALLBACK, "Response from Thread B")
        end
    end
end

-- Create and start threads
local threadAInstance = createThread("ThreadA", threadA)
local threadBInstance = createThread("ThreadB", threadB)

-- Simulate sending a custom signal to Thread A
Thread.sendSignal("ThreadA", SIG_CUSTOM, "Initial signal data")
Explanation
Thread Library and Signal Setup: The Thread library and signal constants are defined.
Create Threads: createThread function initializes and runs threads.
Thread A:
Registers a signal handler for SIG_CALLBACK.
Waits for signals in a loop and processes SIG_CUSTOM signal by notifying Thread B with SIG_CALLBACK.
Thread B:
Waits for signals in a loop and processes SIG_CALLBACK by sending a response signal back to Thread A.
Start Threads: Threads A and B are created and started.
Send Initial Signal: An initial signal is sent to Thread A to demonstrate the process.
This pseudo-code demonstrates how you can implement asynchronous signal handling with callbacks between threads. The registerSignalHandler function allows you to define specific handlers for different signals, enabling threads to communicate and respond to each other asynchronously.
