WowThreads error handling
To effectively manage error handling in your World of Warcraft coroutine-based threads library, you should aim for a strategy that 
provides clarity and control to the client while maintaining the robustness of your library. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step plan:

Error Propagation: Since an error in the coroutine causes it to stop executing and enter a dead state, you should catch these errors at the 
point they occur and then propagate them to the client. This can be done using pcall or xpcall in Lua to handle exceptions safely.
Return Status and Messages: 
Modify your threading functions to return a status flag and an error message if applicable. This dual-return approach (status and optional 
error message) is a common pattern in Lua and is very useful for error handling without causing abrupt stops in the client application.
Status Flag: 
The status returned should be a boolean indicating success (true) or failure (false).
Error Message: In case of an error, alongside the false status, return a descriptive error message that the client can use to determine 
the nature of the problem and decide on the appropriate response.
Handling Dead Coroutines: Provide a mechanism to either restart or cleanly terminate dead coroutines, based on the client's choice. This 
could be through an API function like restartCoroutine(coroutineId) or cleanupCoroutine(coroutineId).
Documentation and Examples: Clearly document how errors are handled and provide examples showing how clients can use the status and error 
messages to manage errors gracefully in their applications.
Utility Functions: Optionally, provide utility functions that can check the state of a coroutine (isCoroutineActive(coroutineId)) or 
retrieve the last error message without needing to run the coroutine again.
Here is a simplified code example to illustrate how you might implement these recommendations:

function safeThreadFunction(func, ...)
    local function threadErrorHandler(err)
        return false, "Error in coroutine: " .. tostring(err)
    end

    local co = coroutine.create(func)
    -- Wrap coroutine.resume to catch errors safely
    local status, result = xpcall(coroutine.resume, threadErrorHandler, co, ...)
    if not status then
        return false, result  -- result contains the error message from threadErrorHandler
    else
        if coroutine.status(co) == "dead" then
            return false, "Coroutine has unexpectedly terminated."
        end
        return true, result  -- result from coroutine function
    end
end

-- Example of client code handling errors
local success, resultOrError = safeThreadFunction(targetFunction, arg1, arg2)
if not success then
    print("Failed to execute thread function:", resultOrError)
else
    print("Thread function executed successfully:", resultOrError)
end

This setup empowers the client to handle errors according to their specific needs, enhances the reliability of your library, and maintains the non-preemptive, cooperative multitasking model typical of Lua coroutines.

Suggestions for your next steps:
a. Implement the error handling strategy and test it with various coroutine functions to ensure reliability.
b. Document the error handling approach and update your API documentation accordingly.
c. Gather feedback from early adopters to refine the error handling if necessary.
